# Sunset orange Dark VSCode theme

My GoTo theme for codding. It's created for my personal use. Feel free to enjoy it's magic :-) It is compatible with color scheme from my Sunset orange GTK theme.

Theme is hugely inspired by [Github Dark Default theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)

If you like this theme and would like to buy me a coffee, you can [Paypal me](https://paypal.me/thekomer) on GitHub!

Will be maintaining this as I have time, thanks for your understanding! ðŸ˜‡
