# Sunset orange Dark VSCode theme

My GoTo theme for coding. It's created for my personal use. It is compatible with color scheme from my Sunset orange GTK theme. Feel free to enjoy it's magic âœ¨

Theme syntax highlighting is hugely inspired by [Github Dark Default theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)

If you like this theme and would like to buy me a coffee, you can [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-Donate-ff6a00.svg?style=flat&logo=paypal)](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/thekomer).

Feel free to notify me of any bugs or possible improvements. I'll gladly consider suggestions as time provides.
I will be maintaining theme as I have time, thanks for your understanding! ðŸ˜‡
